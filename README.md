# Securing_Cloud_Applications
This repo shows how to build, secure, and protect a cloud app that hosts a cyber blog. It requires an understanding of the cloud, cloud security, networking, webdev, crypto, and (obviously) network security.

I used Microsoft Azure to build and host the app.  Then, I secured it with an SSL certificate and finally added additional security features to ensure it remained protected.

## Project Objectives
### Phase 1 - Build
Create Azure web app 
Choose domain
Deploy a container on web app
Make customizations

### Phase 2 - Secure
Create a Key Vault
Create a self-signed certificate
Import and bind self-signed certificate to web app
Create and bind an app service managed certificate

### Phase 3 - Protect
Create a front door
Analyze WAF rule sets
Configure custom WAF rules
Analyze/remediate security center recommendations
