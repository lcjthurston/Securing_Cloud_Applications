# Securing_Cloud_Applications
This repo shows how to build, secure, and protect a cloud app that hosts a cyber blog. It requires an understanding of the cloud, cloud security, networking, webdev, crypto, and (obviously) network security.

I used Microsoft Azure to build and host the app.  Then, I secured it with an SSL certificate and finally added additional security features to ensure it remained protected.

## Project Overview
### Phase 1 - Build
A. Create Azure web app <br>
B. Choose domain <br>
C. Deploy a container on web app <br>
D. Make customizations <br>

### Phase 2 - Secure
E. Create a Key Vault <br>
F. Create a self-signed certificate <br>
G. Import and bind self-signed certificate to web app <br>
H. Create and bind an app service managed certificate <br>

### Phase 3 - Protect
I. Create a front door <br>
J. Analyze WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule sets <br>
K. Configure custom WAF rules <br>
L. Analyze/remediate security center recommendations <br>
